# Blockchain Platform Comparison

## Overview

This comparison analyzes three distinct blockchain platforms representing different deployment models: public, private, and consortium blockchains.

## Comparison Table

| **Blockchain Name**    | **Type**   | **Consensus Mechanism Used** | **Permission Model** | **Speed/Throughput (TPS)** | **Smart Contract Support** | **Token Support**                              | **Typical Use Case**                                                | **Notable Technical Feature**                                           |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ethereum**           | Public     | Proof of Stake (PoS)         | Open                 | 15-20 TPS (Layer 1)        | Yes - Solidity, Vyper      | Native (ETH) + ERC tokens                      | DeFi, NFTs, dApps, Web3 applications                                | EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) enables diverse smart contract ecosystem |
| **Hyperledger Fabric** | Private    | Pluggable (PBFT, Raft, Solo) | Permissioned         | 3,000-20,000 TPS           | Yes - Go, JavaScript, Java | No native token (can create custom assets)     | Enterprise supply chain, healthcare records, identity management    | Modular architecture with pluggable consensus and privacy channels      |
| **R3 Corda**           | Consortium | Notary-based consensus       | Permissioned         | 170-1,700 TPS              | Yes - Kotlin, Java         | No native token (represents real-world assets) | Financial services, trade finance, insurance, regulatory compliance | Point-to-point transactions with legal identity integration             |

## Detailed Analysis

### **Ethereum (Public Blockchain)**

- **Strengths:** Largest developer ecosystem, extensive tooling, high liquidity, battle-tested security
- **Limitations:** High gas fees during congestion, scalability challenges on Layer 1
- **Evolution:** Transitioned from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake in 2022, active Layer 2 scaling solutions

### **Hyperledger Fabric (Private Blockchain)**

- **Strengths:** Enterprise-grade permissions, high throughput, modular design, confidential transactions
- **Limitations:** Complex setup, requires technical expertise, no built-in tokenomics
- **Target:** Organizations needing controlled access with high performance and privacy

### **R3 Corda (Consortium Blockchain)**

- **Strengths:** Built for regulated industries, legal framework integration, privacy-focused design
- **Limitations:** Limited to specific use cases, smaller ecosystem compared to public blockchains
- **Unique Approach:** Only relevant parties see transaction data, mimicking traditional business relationships

## Key Differences Summary

| **Aspect**        | **Public (Ethereum)**       | **Private (Fabric)**           | **Consortium (Corda)**              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Accessibility** | Anyone can join             | Invitation only                | Selected organizations              |
| **Transparency**  | Fully transparent           | Private to network             | Selective transparency              |
| **Governance**    | Decentralized community     | Single organization            | Consortium members                  |
| **Performance**   | Lower TPS, higher latency   | High TPS, low latency          | Moderate TPS, optimized for finance |
| **Compliance**    | Limited built-in compliance | Enterprise compliance features | Regulatory compliance focused       |

## Use Case Recommendations

- **Choose Ethereum** for: Public applications, DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, decentralized governance
- **Choose Hyperledger Fabric** for: Internal enterprise processes, supply chain tracking, document verification
- **Choose R3 Corda** for: Inter-bank transfers, trade finance, insurance claims, regulatory reporting
